HIPE INSTALLATION SUMMARY


1. BUILD AND INSTALL THE DISPLAY SERVER
=======================================

The server process is a Qt application. To build the server, follow the 
instructions in the ./server directory.

The display server can be deployed in a variety of ways depending on the 
target system. See the installaction instructions in the ./server directory 
for more information.

2. INSTALL THE API
=======================================

The API is an ordinary C library with minimal dependencies. To build and 
install the API, see the instructions in the ./api/ directory. You may need 
to edit the makefile if your distribution doesn't follow typical Debian-style 
filesystem layout.

3. TEST THE INSTALLATION
=======================================

The Hipe API includes multiple test applications. These can be compiled 
once the API has been installed on the target system. They will function 
properly if the display server is running correctly.
