To compile the API:
-------------------

$ make


To install: (please also read the note below)
-----------

$ sudo make install


IMPORTANT:

* The makefile is set up to copy headers into /usr/local/include/ and the 
static library file (libhipe.a) into /usr/local/lib/.

* On GNU/Linux-based systems, these are the conventional installation paths
for libraries not installed or managed by package management systems.
However, some OS distributions do not use or provide a /usr/local/ directory
hierarchy.

* Should you wish to install the API into different directories, such as, for 
example, /usr/include/ and /usr/lib/, please modify the 'cp' statements in the
Makefile accordingly.

* UNIX-style systems usually provide a set of three directory hierarchies as
follows: the primary hierarchy in /, a secondary hierarchy in /usr/, tertiary 
hierarchy in /usr/local/. Each hierarchy contains a similar UNIX directory
structure, and the Hipe API can be installed in any one of them (or a different
location entirely) depending on specific system configuration requirements. 
/usr/.... or /usr/local/.... are usually the most appropriate for standard
distributions.


To build test application:
--------------------------

$ make testing



To run test application:
------------------------

* Ensure an instance of the server process is currently running

* Run the compiled test application in ./test/

To install the test applications:
---------------------------------

It can be useful to install the test applications so you can verify
that Hipe is working correctly with the convenience of typing
hipe-clock (or hipe-calc, etc.) from the command line without needing to
look for these in the source tree. Simply run the following:

$ sudo make install-tests
