1.\+10 beta -- 28 Feb 2020

Attempted to commit some fixes that were not in the tree. Replaced the old HIPE\+\_\+\+OP\+\_\+\+SET\+\_\+\+BACKGROUND\+\_\+\+SRC operation with a more general HIPE\+\_\+\+OP\+\_\+\+SET\+\_\+\+STYLE\+\_\+\+SRC operation (can be used with the \char`\"{}background-\/image\char`\"{} style attribute for the same functionality. Since the old instruction has been removed, existing code that used this operation should be modified.

1.\+09 beta -- 9 Jul 2019

Numerous improvements. An instruction framework for modal dialog box implementation is now provided.

1.\+08 beta -- 14 Apr 2019

Numerous bug fixes. Added carat manipulation instructions for accessing and manipulating selections in text input elements.

1.\+07 beta -- 24 Jan 2019

Multiple new instructions, sanitisation of canvas instructions to prevent arbitrary code execution.

v1.\+06 beta -- 21 July 2018

Important bug fix release. Test programs now conveniently installable to help verify a working Hipe environment.

v1.\+05 beta -- 4 July 2018

New instructions and instruction arguments added.

v1.\+04 beta -- 15 May 2018

Documentation cleanup and various bug-\/fixes.

v1.\+03 beta -- 24 Apr 2018

Sending instructions to the server is now an atomic operation.

v1.\+02 beta -- 19 Apr 2018

Fixed a longstanding bug in await\+\_\+instruction that caused the calling client to hang at random.

v1.\+01 beta -- 7 Jan 2018


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item HIPE\+\_\+\+OP\+\_\+\+GET\+\_\+\+SCROLL\+\_\+\+GEOMETRY instruction has been added.
\item HIPE\+\_\+\+OP\+\_\+\+GET\+\_\+\+GEOMETRY instruction has changed. Server now replies with a HIPE\+\_\+\+OP\+\_\+\+GEOMETRY\+\_\+\+RETURN instruction, and the old two-\/step reply instructions have been removed.
\item Socket handling in the hiped server process is now handled with multithreading. Instructions are collected and decoded in a separate thread.
\end{DoxyItemize}

From 1.\+0\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The hipe\+\_\+send() function now supports a variadic syntax. Existing programs will require modification.
\item Hipe now uses a slightly different message-\/passing format between client and server, enabling between zero and four arguments per instruction. (Existing programs require recompilation.)
\item From 0.\+28\+: The argument ordering for the following instructions has been altered\+: HIPE\+\_\+\+OP\+\_\+\+SET\+\_\+\+ICON, HIPE\+\_\+\+OP\+\_\+\+SET\+\_\+\+BACKGROUND\+\_\+\+SRC, HIPE\+\_\+\+OP\+\_\+\+SET\+\_\+\+SRC. Applications that make use of these will need minor modification to work with the new version. This change will ease the transition to a variadic instruction set.
\item C++ $<$hipe$>$ library extension now has a new argument format for the hipe\+::send() function. Arguments should now be enclosed in initialiser list braces \{ \}, and a variable number of arguments may be provided.
\item From 0.\+27\+: A workaround has been added to allow HIPE\+\_\+\+OP\+\_\+\+ADD\+\_\+\+STYLE\+\_\+\+RULE instructions to be respected after initial body content has been added to the screen. Not all style rules added in this scenario appear to be respected by the webkit backend, however.
\end{DoxyItemize}

TODO\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item More robust memory management
\item A transparent PING instruction to allow the hipe display server to identify nonresponsive applications based on when the application last checked for new instructions. Such information could then be passed to (or managed entirely by) the framing manager.
\item More flexible DOM manipulation operations, e.\+g. compliment append with prepend operations.

The latest version is always available via git. Major revisions are available on sourceforge, but these may not reflect the latest bug fixes.

Run the following command and a directory named hipe containing the Hipe distribution will be created in your present working directory\+:
