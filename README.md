v0.19 beta -- 24 Sep 2016

- The hipetec API interface (for C++ users) has been restructured to be more useable. The limitation of only allowing a single session has been removed from hipetec.

TODO:

- Fix bug: canvases don't work unless they are created with ids.
- Add security: sanitise canvas operations to prevent arbitrary code causing performance instability.
