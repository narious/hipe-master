v0.17 beta -- 13 Jul 2016

- Hipe is now relatively feature-complete, but may need additional work to make it more robust and efficient.
- Hipe is now backwards compatible with being built on systems with Qt4.

TODO:

- Fix bug: canvases don't work unless they are created with ids.
- Add security: sanitise canvas operations to prevent arbitrary code causing performance instability.
