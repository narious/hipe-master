v0.19 beta -- 12 Oct 2016

- The hipetec API interface (for C++ users) has been restructured to be more useable. The limitation of only allowing a single session has been removed from hipetec.
- Fixed bug: canvases didn't work unless they were created with ids.

TODO:

- Add security: sanitise canvas operations to prevent arbitrary code causing performance instability.
